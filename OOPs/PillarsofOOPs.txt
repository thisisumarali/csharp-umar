There are 4 pillars of object oriented programming...

1- Inheritance
2- Abstraction
3- Encapsulation
4- Polymorphism

Type of Inheritance 

1- Single Level Inheritance
2- Multilevel Inheritance
3- Hierachical Inheritance
4- Multiple Inheritance

Poly morphs -> many forms

Types of Polymorphism
1- Static Polymorphism (Compile Time Polymorphism)
(early binding)
Two Techniques 
- Method Overloading
- Operator Overloading
2- Dynamic Polymorphism (Run time polymorphism) (later)
